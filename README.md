# vue-several-instances
Learning vue: is it possible to have more than one vue instance? Apparently yes. Should I do it? Rather not.

This project is for (my) learning purposes only and really there's no need for you to fuss around here. ¯\\_o_/¯

If you have nothing more interesting to do you can run the app by simply open index.html in the browser of your choosing.
